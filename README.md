# üè† LA Development Potential Analyzer

> **"What can be built here?"** - Comprehensive development analysis for Los Angeles properties

A professional-grade entitlement analysis platform that transforms complex LA zoning regulations into actionable development intelligence with Netflix-style recommendations and comprehensive regulatory audit.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üèÜ **Netflix-Style Good/Better/Best Recommendations**
- **Smart Ranking**: Scenarios prioritized by units + revenue potential, not arbitrary order
- **Practical Middle Options**: State Density Bonus (10 units, 15% VLI) as the sweet spot between baseline and maximum
- **Revenue Integration**: GPR, NOI, and property value calculations for each scenario
- **Jurisdiction-Aware**: Builder's Remedy only shows when housing element non-compliant

### üìã **Complete Rules Audit**
Comprehensive table showing **every regulation** that applies to the property:
- **Rule**: Regulation name and legal citation
- **Status**: Eligible/Not Eligible/Applies
- **Effect**: Technical impact (density bonus, height limits, etc.)
- **What It Enables**: Human-readable benefits:
  - üèÉ **Faster**: Ministerial vs. discretionary approval 
  - üè¢ **Denser**: Percentage unit increases
  - üìè **Taller/FAR**: Bulk and massing allowances
  - üöó **Less Parking**: Reduction or elimination requirements

### üéØ **Development Scenarios**
- **By-Right Development**: Baseline zoning analysis
- **State Density Bonus**: 15% VLI units ‚Üí +50% density + concessions

- **SB-9 (Duplex/Lot Split)**: R1 zone duplex conversion and lot splitting

### üîì **Clear Unlock Requirements** 
Each scenario shows exactly what triggers it:
- Proximity requirements (transit stops, specific areas)
- Affordability commitments (% of units, income levels)
- Zoning eligibility (residential zones, density factors)
- Jurisdiction compliance status (housing element certification)

### üßÆ **Detailed Unit Calculations**
- Step-by-step math for each scenario showing how units are calculated
- Massing constraints and FAR limitations factored in
- RSO replacement unit requirements

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Data Sources

### **Data Pipeline**
1. **Address Input** ‚Üí Geocoding via LA County services ‚Üí APN identification
2. **LA County GIS API** ‚Üí Property details, lot geometry, assessor data
3. **Analysis Engine** ‚Üí Apply deterministic zoning rules and calculations
4. **Frontend** ‚Üí Clean presentation with expandable technical details

### **Live Data Sources**
- **LA County Parcel Service**: `https://public.gis.lacounty.gov/public/rest/services/LACounty_Cache/LACounty_Parcel/MapServer/0/query`
  - Property boundaries, lot area calculations
  - Existing building details (units, square footage, year built)
  - Assessor data (land value, improvement value)
  - Use codes and property classifications

- **Address Geocoding**: LA County GeocodeServer for address-to-APN conversion
- **Environmental Hazards**: Methane zones, fault zones, liquefaction risk from County GIS layers

### **Regulatory Framework Applied**

#### **Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC)**
Deterministic rules programmed into the analysis engine:

**Density Factors** (Units per lot area):
- R1: 5,000 sq ft per unit
- R2: 800 sq ft per unit  
- R3: 800 sq ft per unit
- R4: 400 sq ft per unit
- R5: 200 sq ft per unit

**Height Districts**:
- Height District 1: 45 feet maximum
- Height District 2: 75 feet maximum  
- Height District 3: 150 feet maximum
- Height District 4: 275 feet maximum

**Parking Requirements** (LAMC 12.21):
- R1: 2.0 spaces per unit
- R2-R5: 1.0 space per unit base requirement

#### **State Regulations**

**State Density Bonus Law (Gov Code 65915 + AB 2345)**:
- Available to multi-family zones (R2, R3, R4, R5)  
- Up to 50% density bonus (increased from 35% in 2020)
- 15% Very Low Income units ‚Üí 50% density bonus
- Up to 3 regulatory concessions allowed
- Cannot be denied if application complies

**AB-1287 Enhanced Density Bonus**:
- Enhanced version allowing up to 100% density bonus
- Focus on moderate and very low income housing ("missing middle")
- Additional concessions available beyond standard density bonus
- By-right approval process

**SB-35 Streamlined Ministerial Approval**:
- Available when jurisdiction hasn't met RHNA goals
- 20% affordable housing requirement
- Ministerial approval (no CEQA review)
- Cannot be denied if compliant with objective standards

**SB-684 Small Site Housing**:
- Ministerial approval for up to 10 units on small sites
- 60-day maximum approval timeline
- CEQA-exempt process
- No affordability requirement
- Available on urban lots under 5 acres

**SB-330 Housing Crisis Act / Builder's Remedy**:
- Available ONLY when jurisdiction's housing element not HCD-certified
- Los Angeles currently compliant (certified through 2029)
- Would override local zoning if activated
- Replacement unit requirements for rent-stabilized properties

**SB-9 (Housing Opportunity and More Efficiency Act)**:
- Duplex conversion allowed on single-family lots (R1 zones)
- Lot splits creating two parcels from one (minimum 1,200 sq ft each)
- Up to 4 total units possible (2 units per split lot)
- Ministerial approval (no discretionary review)
- Owner-occupancy required for 3 years

**AB-2097 (Parking Reduction)**:
- Properties within ¬Ω mile of major transit: Parking minimums eliminated
- Currently using proximity logic (would integrate Metro GTFS data)

**Executive Directive 1 (ED-1)**:
- 100% affordable projects get ministerial approval
- No parking requirements
- Maximum allowable height/FAR (up to +80% density)
- Applied to all residential zones

#### **Local Regulations**

**Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)**:
- Multi-family properties with 2+ units built before 1978
- Requires 1:1 replacement of existing rent-stabilized units
- Detected via property age and unit count

**Transit Oriented Communities (TOC)**:
- Density bonuses based on tier (1: 50%, 2: 60%, 3: 70%, 4: 80%)
- Affordability requirements by tier (8-11% VLI)
- Parking reductions (0.5 spaces/unit or eliminated)
- *Note: Currently using sample data - production would integrate Metro transit stop locations*

## üéØ Use Cases

### **Developers & Investors**
- Pre-acquisition feasibility analysis
- Development program optimization
- Unit yield comparisons

### **Architects & Planners**
- Massing studies and program validation
- Entitlement strategy development

## üîÆ Roadmap

- **Current**: Netflix-style UX with Good/Better/Best ranking system ‚úÖ
- **Phase 2**: Real-time TOC tier calculation via Metro GTFS integration
- **Phase 3**: Interactive map interface with batch property analysis
- **Phase 4**: Permitting timeline integration, construction cost estimation
- **Phase 5**: Pro-forma modeling with financing assumptions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Accuracy & Limitations

### **Data Sources Accuracy**
- **Property Data**: Live from LA County GIS (updated regularly)
- **Zoning Classifications**: Inferred from use codes when ZIMAS unavailable
- **Environmental Hazards**: From County GIS hazard layers
- **TOC Tiers**: Currently sample data - production needs Metro GTFS integration

### **Regulatory Interpretation**
- **LAMC Rules**: Programmed based on published Municipal Code sections
- **State Laws**: Based on current statute language and standard interpretations
- **Feasibility Ratings**: Algorithmic assessment based on constraint analysis

### **Important Disclaimers**
- This tool provides preliminary analysis for informational purposes
- **Not a substitute for professional consultation** with planning experts
- Zoning regulations change - verify current rules with LA City Planning
- Site-specific conditions may affect actual development potential
- Environmental studies and community input can impact feasibility
- **Always consult qualified professionals** before making investment decisions

### **Verification Recommendations**
1. Confirm actual zoning designation with LA City Planning Department
2. Verify TOC tier status with official Metro/City maps
3. Check for recent zoning changes or pending legislation
4. Conduct professional environmental due diligence
5. Engage planning consultants for entitlement strategy
